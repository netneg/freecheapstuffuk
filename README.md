## Broadband & Mobile Contracts on Social Tariff

Social tariffs are special discounted deals available for certain low-income customers. They're generally cheaper than typical broadband tariffs, starting at just £14.40 per month. They also usually aren't subject to price rises or exit fees. You're likely to be eligible for a social tariff if you receive a means-tested state benefit (UC, ESA, PC, JSA) and/or PIP. Qualifying varies by provider.
